MAS[C] PCR is a powerful technique used to genotype or otherwise characterize
large regions of DNA. A typical use case is in the confirmation of large-scale
genomic insertions or recoding in the context of genome engineering. 

The general principle upon which MAS[C] PCR operates is that there are regions
of both sequence homology and divergence between the "wildtype" target region
and the "recoded" target region. We can exploit this patchwork to design a
collection of primer sets that span the region of interest and allow for 
highly-specific genotyping with little ambiguity.

Each primer set consists of 3 individual oligos: 
    Wild type primer (w_primer) :: binds to the wildtype sequence but not the 
                                   recoded sequence
    Discriminatory primer (d_primer) :: binds to the recoded sequence but not 
                                        the wildtype sequence
    Common primer (c_primer) :: binds to both the wildtype and recoded 
                                sequences -- acts as the "reverse" primer for
                                either the w_primer or d_primer

For a given target region, each primer set is designed such that the w_primer +
c_primer and d_primer + c_primer pairs produce the same, unique PCR product
size for their respective templates.
